<!--
The below link will link to the rendered Markdown for your RFC, even before it is merged. You need to adjust it based on your RFC's filename and which fork and branch your PR is from.

* USERNAME: GitHub account or org where your fork of `rfcs` lives. Internal users using a feature branch of `cedar-policy` can just put `cedar-policy` here.

* REPONAME: Probably `rfcs` unless your fork has a different name

* BRANCHNAME: Name of the branch your PR is based on

* FILENAME.md: Filename of your RFC's markdown

Examples:

https://github.com/cedar-policy/rfcs/blob/placeholders-in-conditions/text/0003-placeholders-in-conditions.md

https://github.com/myusername/rfcs/blob/awesome-rfc-idea/text/0001-awesome-rfc-idea.md
